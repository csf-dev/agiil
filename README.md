# The Agiil issue tracker
An issue tracker for agile software development.  It is currently in the **very early stages of development** and is *not recommended for any kind of production usage*.

## Building & running Agiil
If you wish to contribute or evaluate Agiil, please see the documentation about [building Agiil from source] and  [Agiil's runtime dependencies].

[building Agiil from source]: Dev_and_build_dependencies.md
[Agiil's runtime dependencies]: Runtime_dependencies.md

## Reporting issues
[In the spirit of *dogfooding*], Agiil is its own issue tracker.  *Public access to the Agiil tracker is not yet available, although logins may be granted on-request*. It is intended that - once the project sufficiently matures - it will be available for public signup & contributions, likely via a syndicated Github login.

## Continuous integration builds
CI builds are configured via both Travis (for build & test on Linux/Mono) and AppVeyor (Windows/.NET).
Below are links to the most recent build statuses for these two CI platforms.
